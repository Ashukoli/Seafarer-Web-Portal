## User Types & Access Levels

The platform serves three distinct user groups, each with specific needs and access levels. Understanding these roles is crucial for appreciating how the platform operates and generates revenue.

### 1. Administrative Users (Platform Management Team)

**Super Admin (Platform Owner/CTO)**
- **Role**: Has complete control over the entire platform - think of this as the "master key" to everything
- **Access**: Can see all data, modify system settings, handle financial reports, and make platform-wide decisions
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Setting up system configurations (like subscription prices, features)
  - Resolving disputes between candidates and companies
  - Making final decisions on user verification
  - Monitoring platform performance and security
  - Strategic decision making for platform growth

**Sub Admin & Executive (Customer Support & Operations Team)**
- **Role**: Handle day-to-day operations and customer support - like store managers in a retail chain
- **Access**: Can manage users, verify profiles, moderate content, but cannot change system settings
- **Responsibilities**: 
  - Validating candidate profiles and certificates
  - Verifying company documents and licenses
  - Following up with users for additional information
  - Handling customer support inquiries
  - Moderating job postings and messages for inappropriate content
  
**Why This Hierarchy Matters**: This structure ensures security (not everyone can access everything) while maintaining efficient operations (specialized roles for different tasks).

### 2. Company Users (Paying Customers - Primary Revenue Source)

**Company Super Admin (Decision Maker/HR Head)**
- **Role**: The main account holder who makes subscription decisions and manages the company's presence on the platform
- **Access**: Full access to all company features including subscription management, team creation, and billing
- **Login Method**: Mobile/Email OTP (One-Time Password) - no password required for security and convenience
- **Why OTP**: Shipping companies often have team members in different time zones and locations. OTP login is more secure and doesn't require password management.

**Company Sub Admin (HR Team Members/Recruiters)**
- **Role**: Team members who help with daily recruitment activities but don't make subscription decisions
- **Access**: Limited access based on permissions set by the Super Admin (e.g., can search candidates but cannot download resumes)
- **Login Method**: Mobile/Email OTP (Super Admin can control whether they can login via email)
- **Example**: A recruitment officer can search for candidates but only the HR Head can approve downloading detailed profiles.

### 3. Candidates/Seafarers (Service Users & Secondary Revenue Source)

**Who They Are**: Maritime professionals seeking employment - Officers, Engineers, Ratings, Cadets
- **Role**: Create profiles, search jobs, apply for positions, and potentially purchase premium services
- **Access**: Can create detailed profiles, search jobs, apply, message companies, and manage their visibility settings
- **Login Method**: Email and password (traditional login as they access platform frequently)
- **Revenue Potential**: Through Express Service purchases for enhanced visibility

**Why Different Login Methods?**
- **Companies (OTP)**: Often accessing from offices with shared computers, need quick secure access
- **Candidates (Password)**: Personal accounts accessed from personal devices, prefer traditional login

## Candidate Journey

Understanding the candidate journey is crucial because it directly impacts platform quality and company satisfaction. A well-structured candidate profile means companies get better matches, leading to higher subscription renewals.

### Step 1: Registration & Profile Creation
Candidates must complete a comprehensive **7-step registration process**. This might seem lengthy, but it's designed to create detailed profiles that companies actually want to pay to access.

**Why 7 Steps?** Maritime recruitment requires specific information that general job sites don't capture. Each step serves a purpose:

**Form 1: Personal Details**
- **Purpose**: Basic identification and contact information
- **Information Collected**: Name, date of birth, contact information, address, nationality, marital status, WhatsApp contact details
- **Why Important**: Companies need to know nationality for visa requirements, contact methods for immediate communication, and personal details for contract preparation
- **Business Value**: Accurate contact information ensures successful job placements, reducing platform abandonment

**Form 2: Identity Documents**
- **Purpose**: Legal documentation required for maritime employment
- **Information Collected**: Passport details and expiry, CDC (Certificate of Competency) information, US Visa details (if applicable), INDOS number
- **Why Critical**: Every seafarer needs these documents to work legally on ships. Companies filter candidates based on document validity
- **Validation Process**: Admin team verifies document authenticity, ensuring platform credibility

**Form 3: Professional Certificates**
- **Purpose**: Core maritime qualifications that determine job eligibility
- **Information Collected**: Pre-sea training details, COC/COP (Certificate of Competency/Proficiency), Grade and expiry information
- **Industry Context**: These certificates are mandatory for specific ranks. A Chief Engineer must have specific COC to legally operate ship engines
- **Business Impact**: Accurate certification data reduces hiring risks for companies

**Form 4: Endorsements**
- **Purpose**: Specialized maritime certifications for specific ship types or operations
- **Information Collected**: GMDSS (Global Maritime Distress and Safety System), DCE (Dangerous Cargo Endorsement), Other maritime endorsements
- **Market Demand**: Ships carrying dangerous cargo or operating in specific routes require crew with these endorsements
- **Premium Value**: Candidates with rare endorsements can command higher salaries

**Form 5: Valid Courses**
- **Purpose**: Additional training and skill certifications
- **Information Collected**: STCW courses completed, Certificate numbers and completion dates, Specialized training programs
- **Competitive Advantage**: Additional courses make candidates more attractive and can justify premium service purchases
- **Compliance**: Many courses have expiry dates, helping companies ensure crew compliance

**Form 6: Sea Service Experience** (Most Critical Section)
- **Purpose**: Actual work experience on ships - the most valuable information for employers
- **Information Collected**: Previous ship assignments, Ranks held and duration, Ship types and engine specifications, Company names and voyage details
- **Why Detailed**: Ship type experience (Container, Tanker, Bulk Carrier) determines job eligibility. Engine specifications show technical capability
- **Verification**: Cross-referenced with maritime databases where possible
- **Business Logic**: Experience directly correlates with salary and position level

**Form 7: Current Status & Preferences**
- **Purpose**: Current availability and career goals
- **Information Collected**: Present rank and experience, Post preferences (desired next rank), Availability dates, Salary expectations
- **Matching Algorithm**: This data powers the job matching system, showing relevant opportunities
- **Business Value**: Clear availability reduces time-to-hire for companies

### Step 2: Profile Validation (Quality Control)
This step ensures platform credibility and justifies subscription fees for companies.

**Admin Review Process**:
- **Who**: Experienced maritime professionals on the admin team
- **What**: Document verification, experience validation, information completeness check
- **Timeline**: 24-48 hours for standard profiles, longer for complex cases
- **Quality Gates**: Profiles must meet minimum standards before becoming searchable

**Status Progression**:
1. **Pending**: Just submitted, awaiting review
2. **Under Review**: Admin team actively checking documents
3. **Validated**: Approved and searchable by companies
4. **Rejected**: Issues found, candidate must resubmit with corrections

**Notes System**: 
- Admins can add specific feedback ("Passport expires in 6 months, please renew")
- Candidates receive detailed feedback for improvement
- Creates audit trail for quality assurance

**Business Impact**: Only validated profiles are searchable, ensuring companies get quality candidates worth paying for.

### Step 3: Job Search & Application
Once validated, candidates can actively search for opportunities and apply to relevant positions.

**Advanced Search Capabilities**:
- **By Rank**: From Deck Cadet to Master Mariner, Engine Cadet to Chief Engineer
- **By Ship Type**: Container, Tanker, Bulk Carrier, Passenger, Offshore, etc.
- **By Nationality Requirements**: Some companies prefer specific nationalities due to visa agreements
- **By Experience Level**: Minimum sea service requirements
- **By Joining Location**: Where the candidate can join the ship
- **By Salary Range**: Expected compensation levels

**Application Process**:
- **One-Click Application**: Simple process to encourage applications
- **Application Tracking**: Candidates can see which companies viewed their applications
- **Status Updates**: Applied → Viewed by Company → Interview → Hired/Rejected

**Why Simple Application**: Maritime professionals often apply from ships with limited internet. Simple process increases application completion rates.

### Step 4: Premium Services (Revenue Generation from Candidates)
Optional services that candidates can purchase to improve their job prospects.

**Express Service Packages**: Enhanced visibility and priority placement
- **Target Audience**: Candidates struggling to get responses or wanting faster job placement
- **Value Proposition**: 3x more profile views, direct company contact, instant job alerts
- **Psychology**: Candidates invest in their career advancement, similar to LinkedIn Premium

**Direct Company Contact (Resume Blaster)**:
- **Feature**: Send resume directly to companies even without job postings
- **Use Case**: Proactive job seeking, networking with preferred companies
- **Business Value**: Additional touchpoint between candidates and companies

**SMS Alerts**: Instant notifications for new job postings
- **Critical Timing**: Maritime jobs often have short application windows
- **Competitive Advantage**: First applicants often get preference
- **Technical Implementation**: SMS integration with job posting system

## Company Journey

Companies are the primary revenue generators for the platform. Understanding their journey helps explain how the business model works and why certain features exist.

### Step 1: Registration & Verification (Building Trust & Credibility)

**Company Registration Process**:
The registration process is designed to ensure only legitimate maritime companies join the platform, protecting both candidates and platform reputation.

**Required Information**:
- **Company Details**: Legal company name, business address, contact information
- **Business Registration Documents**: Certificate of incorporation, business license
- **RPSL Details**: Recruitment and Placement Services License (mandatory for maritime recruitment)
- **Director Information**: Key personnel and company structure
- **Maritime Credentials**: Evidence of maritime industry involvement

**Why Verification is Critical**:
- **Legal Compliance**: Maritime recruitment is heavily regulated internationally
- **Candidate Protection**: Prevents fraudulent companies from accessing candidate data
- **Platform Credibility**: Verified badge increases company credibility with candidates
- **Revenue Protection**: Ensures subscription fees are paid by legitimate businesses

**Verification Process Timeline**:
1. **Immediate**: Basic information review (1-2 hours)
2. **Document Verification**: Admin team checks business licenses (24-48 hours)
3. **Maritime Verification**: Confirms RPSL and maritime industry connection (2-3 days)
4. **Final Approval**: Complete verification and account activation

**Status Tracking for Transparency**:
- **Pending**: Application submitted, awaiting review
- **Under Review**: Admin team actively verifying documents
- **Verified**: Full platform access granted with verified badge
- **Rejected**: Issues found, company must resubmit with corrections

**Business Impact**: Only verified companies can access candidate data, justifying subscription fees and ensuring candidate trust.

### Step 2: Subscription Selection (Revenue Model Core)

This is where the platform generates its primary revenue. Companies choose from flexible subscription packages designed to meet different business needs and budgets.

**Three Main Subscription Categories**:

**1. Resume Database Access** (Core Service):
Companies need to find the right candidates, so they pay for access to search and contact candidates.

**Daily Limits Structure**:
- **Starter Package**: 5 views/downloads per day (₹5,000/month)
- **Professional**: 15 views/downloads per day (₹12,000/month)
- **Business**: 25 views/downloads per day (₹18,000/month)
- **Premium**: 50 views/downloads per day (₹30,000/month)
- **Enterprise**: 75 views/downloads per day (₹40,000/month)
- **Corporate**: 100 views/downloads per day (₹50,000/month)
- **Unlimited**: No daily limits (₹75,000/month)

**Why Daily Limits?**:
- **Revenue Predictability**: Ensures consistent monthly revenue
- **Fair Usage**: Prevents one company from downloading entire database
- **Upgrade Incentive**: Companies naturally upgrade as they grow
- **Resource Management**: Controls server load and database access

**2. Hot Job Posting** (Premium Recruitment Service):
Companies pay extra for enhanced job visibility and faster candidate responses.

**Features Included**:
- **Priority Placement**: Jobs appear at top of search results
- **SMS Notifications**: Instant alerts sent to matching candidates
- **Enhanced Visibility**: Special highlighting and badges
- **Faster Responses**: Candidates respond 3x faster to Hot Jobs

**Pricing Tiers**:
- **5 Hot Jobs/month**: ₹8,000
- **15 Hot Jobs/month**: ₹20,000
- **25 Hot Jobs/month**: ₹30,000
- **50 Hot Jobs/month**: ₹50,000
- **Unlimited Hot Jobs**: ₹80,000

**Business Logic**: Hot Jobs generate urgent hiring needs and command premium pricing due to immediate candidate notification.

**3. Combined Packages** (Value Proposition):
Bundled services at discounted rates encourage higher spending and longer commitments.

**Example Packages**:
- **SME Bundle**: 15 views + 5 Hot Jobs = ₹18,000 (save ₹2,000)
- **Corporate Bundle**: 50 views + 15 Hot Jobs = ₹45,000 (save ₹5,000)
- **Enterprise Bundle**: Unlimited views + Unlimited Hot Jobs = ₹120,000 (save ₹35,000)

**Common Expiry Date**: All services within a package expire on the same date, simplifying billing and encouraging package renewals.

### Step 3: Team Management (Scalability Feature)

Large shipping companies need multiple team members to access the platform. This feature increases customer value and justifies higher subscription tiers.

**Sub-admin Creation**:
- **Purpose**: Allow HR teams, recruiters, and regional managers to access platform
- **Limit Control**: Company Super Admin sets maximum number of sub-admins
- **Cost Structure**: Additional sub-admins may cost extra (₹2,000/month per additional user)

**Permission Control System**:
Companies can control what each team member can access:
- **View Only**: Can search candidates but cannot download resumes
- **Download Allowed**: Can download candidate profiles
- **Job Posting**: Can create and manage job postings
- **Messaging**: Can communicate with candidates
- **Analytics**: Can view company performance reports

**Activity Tracking**:
- **User Actions**: Track what each team member does
- **Usage Reports**: Show which team members are most active
- **Billing Transparency**: Companies see how their subscription is being used
- **Performance Metrics**: Identify top-performing recruiters

**Why This Matters**: Team management features justify higher subscription tiers and create user stickiness (harder to switch platforms when multiple team members are trained).

### Step 4: Candidate Search & Recruitment (Value Delivery)

This is where companies get value from their subscription investment. The search and recruitment process must be efficient and effective to justify ongoing payments.

**Advanced Search Filters** (Powered by detailed candidate profiles):
- **Rank Experience**: Find candidates with specific rank experience (e.g., minimum 2 years as Second Officer)
- **Ship Type Expertise**: Filter by vessel types (Container, Tanker, LNG, etc.)
- **Nationality Preferences**: Important for visa and crew mix requirements
- **Availability Windows**: Find candidates available within specific time frames
- **Certification Requirements**: Search by specific certificates and endorsements
- **Geographic Location**: Find candidates in specific regions for easier joining
- **Salary Expectations**: Match budget with candidate expectations

**Profile Interaction Workflow**:
1. **Search Results**: List of matching candidates with key information preview
2. **Profile View**: Detailed candidate information (counts against daily limit)
3. **Download Resume**: Full profile download for offline review (counts against daily limit)
4. **Contact Candidate**: Send message through platform messaging system
5. **Application Management**: If candidate applied to company jobs, manage applications

**Why Subscription Model Works**:
- **Immediate Value**: Companies see relevant candidates immediately after payment
- **Quality Assurance**: All candidates are pre-verified, saving company time
- **Competitive Advantage**: Access to candidates not available on free platforms
- **Efficiency**: Advanced filters save hours compared to manual CV screening
- **Success Tracking**: Companies can measure ROI through successful hires

**Direct Messaging Integration**:
- **Secure Communication**: Built-in messaging protects both parties
- **Conversation History**: Track all interactions with candidates
- **Privacy Protection**: Candidates' personal contact info remains private until mutual agreement
- **Response Tracking**: Companies can see message read status and response rates

**Application Management**:
- **Centralized Dashboard**: All applications in one place
- **Candidate Comparison**: Side-by-side comparison of multiple applicants
- **Status Tracking**: Move candidates through hiring pipeline
- **Team Collaboration**: Multiple team members can review and comment on applications

**Resume Viewing Packages**:

**Resume Download Packages** (Same tier structure with separate pricing):
